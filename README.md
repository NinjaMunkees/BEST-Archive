# BEST-Archive
This repo is an archive of code from previos B.E.S.T. robotics seasons. All of our code is writen in RobotC.
The main programmer from the 2018 season throught the 2021 season is https://github.com/RavenTheBlank, and I (https://github.com/B-Pence) helped out on the 2021 season (mainly our autonomous code based on battery voltage). Before that i don't have much info on who worked on code.
